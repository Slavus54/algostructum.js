### Description

Interesting algorithms & data structures on JavaScript.

Some of them are my ideas in code. Other have been imported from great repository of Oleksii Trekhleb -

### Get Started

1. import {Algostructum} from 'algostructum.js'
2. const instance = new Algostructum()

### Methods

*bit* (**num** = 42) - convert an integer to binary number.   	

*euclidean* (**a** = 1, **b** = 2) - find GCD of numbers.         	

*jump* (**arr** = []) - own realization of greedy Jump Algorithm with other way to calculate distance;    
returns an object {jumps, max, flag}.      	

*accuracy* (**body** = '', **arr** = [], **marker** = 'x') - gain function with array of arguments and give away        	
maximum of accuracy finded as product of (y / x) and y variable's fraction.  		

*fib* (**num** = 0) - returns list of Fibonacci numbers.
